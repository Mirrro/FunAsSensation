While exploring the MDA framework’s Sensation aesthetic - the “game as sense-pleasure” LeBlanc describes - I reworked a simple Whack-a-Mole demo with extra visual juice: particle bursts, screen shake, combo streaks, and more. The core mechanics remain unchanged, but toggling each effect reshapes the experience, revealing how identical actions can feel completely different when feedback is amped up.

_________
- **VFX**  
  Shows particles when moles appear or get hit, breathing life into every action.  
- **Screen Shake**  
  Briefly rattles the camera on each hammer strike, making hits feel powerful.  
- **Counter**  
  Scales the score text up and down on each point, emphasizing each catch.  
- **Combo**  
  Tracks consecutive hits and triggers a combo effect - think Candy Crush streaks - to amplify player impact.  
- **SFX & Music**  
  Plays sound effects on mole events and loops a background track.  
- **Look at Mouse**  
  Moles subtly follow the cursor, reinforcing player agency and immersion.  
- **Post-Processing**  
  Applies bright, flashing color filters—dopamine-friendly visuals that heighten excitement.  
- **Hit Color**  
  Flashes the mole red on impact, providing clear, immediate damage feedback.

By toggling these effects, this showcase illustrates how _sensory feedback_ alone can transform a simple demo into a rich lesson on what makes games fun.
